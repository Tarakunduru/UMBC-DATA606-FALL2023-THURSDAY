##  Background

## What is it about? 
Credit card fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning in the financial sector. It involves using computational techniques to identify and prevent unauthorized or fraudulent credit card transactions. This process is essential for safeguarding the financial interests of both cardholders and financial institutions. Here are the key aspects of credit card fraud detection using machine learning:
	
## Why does it matter? 
Credit card fraud detection is crucial for safeguarding individuals and financial institutions from monetary losses. Without effective detection, fraudulent transactions can result in significant financial harm, impacting both cardholders and banks. Detecting fraud allows for timely intervention, reducing financial losses for all parties involved. Credit card transactions involve sensitive personal and financial information. Detecting fraud helps protect this data from being exploited by malicious actors. By keeping data secure, credit card fraud detection not only prevents financial losses but also reduces the risk of identity theft and other forms of cybercrime.

## What are your research questions? 
Are there time-related trends in credit card transactions, and can we predict future transaction behavior?
Can we identify distinct customer segments based on transaction behavior, and how can this information be used for targeted marketing or risk assessment?
How can machine learning models effectively detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the provided features?
