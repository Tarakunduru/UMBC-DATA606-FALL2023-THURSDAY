## 2. Background

### What is it about?

The Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction project leverages historical booking data to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled. the dataset contains various features related to bookings. The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model for accurate predictions to assist hotel managers in inventory management and pricing strategies. The project will involve data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and deployment. The project aims to improve hotel revenue, reduce operational costs, and enhance customer satisfaction despite the challenges of imbalanced data, missing values, and model integration.

### Why does it matter?

The Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction project matters because it helps hotels optimize revenue, manage room inventory, improve customer service, and make informed strategic decisions. By accurately predicting cancellations, hotels can adjust pricing, accommodate guests during peak periods, enhance customer satisfaction, and gain a competitive advantage. This project is crucial for reducing financial impact and improving overall business outcomes in the highly competitive hospitality industry.

### What are your reasearch questions?

What features in the booking data are the most significant predictors of booking cancellations?

How does the performance of the cancellation prediction model vary across different hotels or hotel chains?

Can the model's predictions be used to optimize pricing strategies and improve revenue management?

* Which variable/column will be your target/label in your ML model?

In the Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction project, the target variable (also known as the label) will be the is_canceled column. This binary variable indicates whether a booking was canceled (1) or not (0). The goal of the machine learning model will be to predict this variable based on the other features in the dataset.
